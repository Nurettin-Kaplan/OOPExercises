# Object-Oriented Programming Exercises

Welcome to my repository for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises, which I completed as part of the "Object-Oriented Programming with Applications" course from BTK Akademi. This repository contains various examples and exercises that demonstrate key OOP concepts and techniques.

## Course Overview

Throughout this course, I explored and practiced the following topics:

- **Programming Paradigms**
- **Object/Class Design**
- **Class Definition**
- **Inheritance**
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Interfaces**
- **Static Classes**
- **Duck Typing and Generic Concepts**
- **Relationships Between Objects**

## Languages Used

The exercises and examples in this repository are implemented in the following programming languages:

- C++
- C#
- Java
- Python

These implementations help illustrate the core principles of object-oriented programming across different languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nurettin-Kaplan/OOPExercises.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   ```bash
   cd OOPExercises
   ```

3. **Explore the Examples**

   Each language has its own directory with relevant exercises. You can explore these directories to view and run the examples.

## Example Projects

The repository includes various example projects that apply the concepts learned in the course. Each project folder contains source code files and, where applicable, instructions for running the projects.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Zafer CÃ¶mert and BTK Akademi for providing such a comprehensive and valuable course.
