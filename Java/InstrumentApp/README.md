# Java Music Instruments Application

## Requirements

### Instrument Representation:
Define an `Instrument` interface to represent different types of musical instruments. Each musical instrument (e.g., guitar, piano) should implement this interface.

### Play Functionality:
Define a `play` method that represents the ability of each musical instrument to be played.

### Musical Instrument Classes:
Create separate classes (e.g., `Guitar`, `Piano`) to represent different musical instruments. Each class should implement the `Instrument` interface and provide its customized implementation of the `play` method.

### Main Application:
Create a main class (e.g., `Main`) where instances of musical instruments are created and the `play` methods are called.

### Output:
Provide an output that shows how the musical instruments are played and what type they are.
